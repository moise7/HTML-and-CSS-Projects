  <blockquote>
    The Central African Republic conflict is an ongoing civil war in the Central African Republic (CAR) involving the government, rebels from the Séléka coalition, and anti-balaka militias.[22]

In the preceding Central African Republic Bush War (2004–2007), the government of President François Bozizé fought with rebels until a peace agreement in 2007. The current conflict arose when a new coalition of varied rebel groups, known as Séléka,[23] accused the government of failing to abide by the peace agreements[22] and captured many towns at the end of 2012. The capital was seized by the rebels in March 2013,[24] Bozizé fled the country,[25] and the rebel leader Michel Djotodia declared himself president.[26] Renewed fighting began between Séléka and militias called anti-balaka.[27] In September 2013, President Djotodia disbanded the Séléka coalition, which had lost its unity after taking power, and in January 2014, Djotodia resigned.[28][29] He was replaced by Catherine Samba-Panza,[30] but the conflict continued.[31] In July 2014, ex-Séléka factions and anti-balaka representatives signed a ceasefire agreement in Brazzaville.[32] By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned with the anti-Balaka controlling the south and west, from which most Muslims had evacuated, and ex-Seleka groups controlling the north and east.[33]

Much of the tension is over religious identity between Muslim Séléka fighters and Christian anti-balaka. Other contributing factors include ethnic differences among ex-Séléka factions and historical antagonism between agriculturalists, who largely comprise anti-balaka, and nomadic groups, who constitute most Séléka fighters.[34] More than 1.1 million people have fled their homes in a country of about 5 million people, the highest ever recorded in the country
